                        THE YEAR – 1966. <br>
                        THE MAN – Mr.Abdul Rahim from Malaysia. <br>
                        THE PLACE – A small restaurant housed in one of the alleys of historic Shivajinagar,
                        Bangalore. <br> <br>

                        This is where we began… <br> <br>

                        Back in 1966, Mr. Abdul Rahim Haji, armed with a strong background in the catering business,
                        came to India from Malaysia. He opened the first Empire Restaurant in a small alley in
                        Shivajinagar, Bangalore, which humbly served healthy & authentic recipes, alongside the
                        newspaper and early morning banter. His eager customers just came by for a hot, steaming
                        cuppa chai, or even ‘Haji’s Kappa and Mutton’ for breakfast! Here was a man with not only a
                        passion for food but also a keen business sense.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div><br><br><br>
            <p>
                No dreamer is ever too small, no dream ever too big.
                Empire has come a long way. There are older restaurants and places with cooler backstories
                maybe, but for nearly 50 plus years, everyone in Bangalore and beyond, young and old, is
                familiar with ‘Empire Restaurant’.
                <br>
                The early days were tougher times, but Mr.Abdul Haq single-handedly made ‘Empire’ possible.
                Abdul Rahim’s younger son Abdul Azeez joined his brother Abdul Haq and together they ran the
                business with grit and fervour. Exotic food like brain fry and kebabs were served, and also
                affordable ghee rice and Kerala Parotta. They consistently built rapport, making each
                interaction with customers unique; such was their passion, a sure winner all the way!
                <br>
                When the building, which housed the restaurant, had to be demolished for renovation, it is said
                that Abdul Haq with the help of his brothers, managed the demolition even as they ran the
                business from one section of the shop.
                <br>
                From a small, obscure cafeteria, Empire has grown to the latest lush Highway Restaurant en-route
                Bangalore-Mysore. The Empire journey that began in 1966, with one person and the F&B business he
                built, is as legendary as the exotic and affordable food that’s served till date.
                <br>
                Today, if Mr.Abdul Rahim Haji could witness the pinnacles to which his children and
                grandchildren have taken his dreams, he would be a proud man! For a restaurant business spanning
                5 decades, it is no small feat to stay relevant and fresh, and surely, Empire has achieved it!
                <br><br><br>
                <b>Discover the Empire Experience</b><br><br>
                A sense of playfulness is instilled in our dishes, with innovative cooking techniques and unique
                presentations that we can confidently say will stimulate your mind as well as your senses.
                <br>
                Empire is proud that the food served is one that people can have on a daily basis. Through
                personal interpretations of ingredients and taste, the meticulous cooks have arrived at a
                scrumptious menu where flavour, texture and harmony are paramount.
                <br>
                Right from the selection of our raw materials, our meat and poultry, from cooking to our final
                presentation before our valued customer, every stage is scrutinised and is of utmost importance
                to us.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>Seafood</b><br><br>
                <br>
                Enjoy the fresh Seafood cooked with aromatic spices and rich flavour, balanced to perfection, a
                must for all pescetarians. These tasty morsels have sustained our palates for centuries – Red
                snapper and pomfrets and Amur barbequed to perfection, Al-Faham, Tawa delicacies, Hot Chilli
                Basa, Squid, Spicy Lemon Basa, the fillets, are some of Empire’s all-time favourites.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>Empire Juice shops</b><br><br>
                <br>
                The truth is that it wasn’t started without a thought. Forget coffee shops, juice shops turned
                out to be a very promising business opportunity then and this was what planted the seed. Thus
                was born Empire Juice shops. Now it’s been years that the Juice shops have been making enticing
                smoothies and juices; here, the know-how of the right combinations and experimenting with
                different flavours is a given. The menu boasts simple concoctions like Faloodas with a twist,
                fruit salads and natural ice creams. The natural fruit juices do not contain any added water.
                <br>
                We continue to love what we do and are a growing business.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>Vegetarea</b><br><br>
                <br>
                That’s what we love to call it and that’s what it is called. If you are vegetarian and you love
                simple, homely food you must visit here! The highway beckons every traveller to eat healthy food
                so that his journey is without discomfort and we take great care in serving authentic vegetarian
                recipes from namma Karnataka. These restaurants are a home away from home, where fresh and
                colourful food full of flavour is cooked daily on the premises. Our restaurants each with their
                own style and personality offer clean and hygienic food, that are easy on the stomach and the
                pocket!

        <h2 style="  color: #d9ba85;">RISE OF SPICE TOUCH</h2><br><br>
        <p>
            It has been an exciting five decades; we have prudently grown along with the city. Empire Restaurant is now
            one among the leading chains of restaurants in Bangalore. We have a heartfelt need to showcase to the world
            the cuisine of Bangalore, as our loyalties lie in this city. It goes without saying that Bangalore is on the
            radar of everyone from foodies to families and is perfect for a weekend outing, but it is also this
            beautiful city and the people that gave us the opportunity to pursue our dreams and make it a reality, and
            hence the love for this gorgeous city.
            <br><br>
            Empire is proud of its progress, under management that has been competent and instrumental in achieving the
            milestones thus far. All progress takes place outside the comfort zone and under the towering leadership of
            late Mr.Abdul Haq, Hotel Empire took a remarkable turn in terms of service and business. They say people who
            succeed have momentum, the more they succeed, and the more they endeavour to reach higher plateaus. Today,
            the family’s third generation of achievers is taking the Empire chain to the next level.
            <br><br>
            Empire is not simply a restaurant; it is a world of passion where we relate to the need to offer people with
            sumptuous and satisfying food, thereby finding a place in their hearts. It is a unique place, where every
            creation and every element has its own meaning because they contribute to creating a journey, to discover
            the gastronomic culture of a country. We take every opportunity to give our patrons an intense and
            enveloping taste experience, in which the flavours and colours, together with that spark of inspiration and
            creativity, satisfies and delights a hungry belly.
            <br><br>
            We never sit on our laurels. At Empire, we continue to test new technology, cooking methods, marketing
            tactics, and even new ways to operate our business to create the best culture and food. We presently have
            arrived at a sustainable business model though profit was never our purpose. On the contrary, our driving
            force is ‘volume’. Under the aegis of our late Mr.Abdul Haq, there was a remarkable shift in our strategies
            in 2007 to expand across the city. We flaunt a common theme across all our 24 outlets in a very standardised
            operation, following the ‘central kitchen’ concept for quality procurement and taste consistency.
            <br><br>
            Food is a language that connects and is also the identity of a people. Our dream is to make Empire a place
            to come back to, because, to us, our customer is our honoured guest and will be treated like a king, every
            time.
