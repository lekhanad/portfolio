          <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p class="overview"> This summer residence of Tipu Sultan was built in the year 1791. The ceilings and walls of the palace have a floral touch with Islamic carvings and decorations. 
        The uniqueness of this two storey building is that it is entirely made of teak wood with wooden pillars supporting the foundation of the palace. It is said that Sultan used the eastern and western balconies to conduct the mass and state affairs. 
        The intricately carved wooden balcony and the majestic staircases are great examples of architectural marveling and the size of the palace is not magnanimous yet it gives a rustic touch to the state of Karnataka. It is one of the Bangalore tourist places which is included in almost all the itineraries. <br></p>
