     <h1>Overview    </h1>
     <p class="overview">
        Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium shortly referred to as JNP is a hotspot tourist attraction amongst science and space-loving kids and their parents. Administered by Bangalore Association for Science Education
         (BASE), the Sky Theatre at
         the planetarium is the key attraction.
        This dome-shaped theatre hosts several shows that kindle the curiosity of people of all ages to know more about the celestial objects like the sun, moon, planets, meteors, black holes, and many others.
        There are also shows that give one a comprehensive knowledge about the history of space research developments like the first landing of the man on space and space missions. 
        The second huge draw at the planetarium is the “Telescope” which is placed in an observatory. On special astronomical events like sighting a particular planet or eclipses, one can observe the happenings
         of the sky right through the telescope. 
        The Bangalore Planetarium has a Science Park where kids can enjoy witnessing their classroom taught Physics experiments like resonance in an open space. JNP is frequented by school children so that the young 
        minds get hands-on knowledge about space and the technologies used in space missions that foster these young champs to become pioneers in future space research developments.
        JNP conducts several events like “Know Your Stars” and “Monthly Movies”. During these days, space lovers from all parts of the city gather at the planetarium to participate in the special lectures and workshops. 
        The planetarium stands out from its contemporaries with its state-of-the-art technologies and highly sophisticated architecture that is the most sought after venue for scholarly discussions and science events in the city.

            <h1>What Not To Miss   </h1>
            <p class="overview">  Currently, three shows happen at Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium. You can book the tickets online or buy one at the counter. 
                Our solar system: Kick-starting with a glimpse of a typical night sky in Bangalore, this show takes the audience through constellations and mythological stories around them. Then, the show proceeds to explain the strange motions of the planets.
                And then, a discussion of helio-centric theory and geocentric theory is featured. Then, historical events like Galileo and Cassini missions are shown. The entire show lasts for about 40 minutes and the show is designed end-to-end by Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium, Bangalore.
                The 3D animations and high-resolution images used during the show gives the audience an "immersive feel". The show is aired in Kannada at 2.30 PM and in English at 12.30 PM.
                Dawn of the Space Age: Featuring how the man got excited about space and how that excitement and commitment led to various milestones being reached, Dawn of the Space Age is one of the spectacular planetarium shows.
                Various accomplishments like Yuvi Gagarin being the first man in space, the first spacewalk by Alexey Leonov, Neil Armstrong's attempt is using Docking, and many others are interestingly explained in this show. 
                The show also explains how the initial competition between the USSR and the US to show their supremacy in space research finally developed into many successful collaborations. The show happens in English at 10.30 am and in Kannada at 11:30 am. This show is screened only on Sundays.
                Celestial Fireworks: As the name suggests, this show features all the aggressive commotions happening in the space like meteors burning up and meteorites creating crates on the Earth.
                The highlight of the show is the one featuring the life cycle of a star. While we see a star just as a blinking thing studded in the black sky, the star goes through several lifecycle stages like the white dwarf stage, the formation of Supernovae, Neutron stars, pulsars and finally Black Holes. 
\                The Big Bang theory which literally is a celestial firework is also portrayed during the show. The program spans about 40 minutes and is aired in English at 4.30 PM and Kannada at 3.30 PM every day.</p>
