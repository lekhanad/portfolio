The park has an amphitheater for speakers which also serves an ideal platform for conducting public meetings, protests as it can accommodate a large mass of people.  
        In the center of the park lies a tower that served the purpose of observing prisoners, massive barracks to separate high profile prisoners from common ones. 
        With ample of parking space and a quirky cafeteria, this park encompasses many other points of interests such as Water Fountain, Sculpture court, Jail Museum, Book Museum, People Courtyard and enough space for children to run around and play.
