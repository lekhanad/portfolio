        The rampant and the remnants of the fort can be witnessed in the K. R market area. As a large portion of the fort vanishes today, the Tipu Sultan’s summer palace was a part of the fort which now looks as a separate entity. 
        Kempe Gowda also made a temple dedicated to his daughter in Koramangala for her act of self-sacrifice to benefit the construction of the fort. As the southern gate of the fort would fall every time it was built so someone suggested a human sacrifice, Gowda did not agree to this act but his daughter self-sacrificed herself.  </p>
