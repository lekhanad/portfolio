    <h1>History of Iskcon</h1>
    <p class="overview">
    The International Society for Krishna Consciousness was initiated in the year 1976 by Krishna devotees from across the world. The ISKCON Temple in Bangalore was first established in 1998 under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960.
    The goals of this society are derived from the Seven Purposes of ISKCON as stated by Srila Prabhupada. Initially, the temple was operating from a rented house in Bangalore. 
    It was around the year 1987 when the temple was moved to the grounds, on Hare Temple Road, which was then an empty "kharab land" (wasteland).
    To make this land more befitting of housing the splendid temple,  Sri Madhu Pandit Das, a qualified engineer who was then the President of the ISKCON Bangalore, conceptualized a beautiful temple of splendid architecture, which he then built along with Sri Jagat Chandra Dasa, an architect himself.
    The construction of the temple began in 1990, and around 600 skilled artisans were employed for the purpose. 
    The construction finally ended in the year 1997.  On the same year, the Temple was inaugurated by the ninth President of India- Shankar Dayal Sharma. </p>

        Apart from these, the temple also has separate prayer halls dedicated to Sri Sri Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Sri Krishna Balarama, Sri Sri Nitai Gauranga, Sri Srinivasa Govinda and Sri Prahlada Narasimha.
